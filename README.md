# Assistant

*Note that a lot of this code was written when I was still learning proper coding practices and C# so it can probably be significantly improved. Some may also be leftover code from trying to figure stuff out*

*This documenation is by no means complete. Send me an email if you have questions*

Assistant is supposed to be a quick way to "shortcut" the process of doing a lot of things on your computer such as:

- Launching programs
- Opening files
- Setting a reminder
- Sending a quick email
- etc

### Getting set up

1. Download the repo and build so you have an `Assistant.exe` file
2. Create a `%appdata%\Assistant` folder and inside that folder create a `Commands.xml` with the commands you want to define for Assistant ([Example](https://github.com/derekantrican/Assistant/blob/master/Sample%20Files/Commands.xml))
3. *Optional:* Make a keyboard shortcut to quickly launch Assistant ([Example using AHK](https://github.com/derekantrican/Assistant/blob/master/Sample%20Files/KeyboardShortcuts.ahk))
